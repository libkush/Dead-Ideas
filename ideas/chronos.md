# Chronos

A mobile app that asks you "why?" everytime you open distracting apps. It is not a "blocker" to forcefully block you out from using your apps but merely a notifier that holds you accountable.

## Why

Most popular tools like [LeechBlock](https://www.proginosko.com/leechblock/) and [Freedom](https://freedom.to/) allow you to completely block certain apps/websites from your device.
This is a rather harsh and brute-force method to stay productive, often feeling like a "restriction" on your freedom to use your device fully. Moreover, the harder it is to bypass the restrictions, the harder one tries to overcome them.

Instead of this, it is way more effective to simply "remind" the user of his/her actions and hold them accountable for the wasted time to make them realise and restrict themselves from being distracted.

## How 

Chronos can ask you a simple question like

- Do you REALLY need to use <APP_NAME> right now?
- Can <APP_NAME> wait for it's designated time?
- By using <APP_NAME>, is technology serving you, or are you serving technology?

... and so on from a customized set of questions that the user can configure, every time you open any distracting app with <APP_NAME>.

And questions like

- Do you think your <NUMBER_OF_MINUTES> were spent on something meaningful?
- Was using <APP_NAME> for <NUMBER_OF_MINUTES> within your acceptable limits?

... and so on once the user quits a distracting app.

The user can set what apps are distracting according to their will.

### Useful References

The idea is HEAVILY inspired from [Intenty](https://www.intenty.app/). The only key difference being that Intenty asks a question every time on device startup, which ends up being a nuisance whenever you need to do something on your phone urgently.
Also, it becomes a muscle memory to simply ignore the question after a certain point. Hence, it is more practical for the app to remind you only when opening certain distracting apps rather than device startup.
